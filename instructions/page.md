# Tasks

In the left pane there is a terminal session on the ubuntu container.
We want the user to perform actions in the terminal and then validate that the actions had the desired outcome.

Each task can have multiple conditions that need to be met before the task is considered completed. 

<instruqt-task id="helloworld">
  Write the text `world` to `/tmp/hello`.
</instruqt-task>
