# Difficult to Collaborate on, and Reuse Content

It is extremely difficult to collaborate on content and reuse previous work without duplicating it.

## Overwriting Eachother's Changes

> When troubleshooting a track, we canâ€™t work on the same track collaboratively, because you end up overwriting each others changes.
>
> We have to each create a clone and troubleshoot that separately, then have a horrible time figuring out the right way to merge once done.

## Duplicating Content for Minor Variations

> Right now when they create a track they want available in different languages, they have to clone it and edit the text manually.
