# Explicit Dependencies to Manage Complexity

✅ Handle dependencies between resources automatically in the platform, instead of user scripts.

✅ Have the order that things happen in be idempotent so they are predictable and reliable.

✅ Handle health checking in the resources themselves on a platform level, instead of in the dependent user scripts.

✅ Make it possible to chain together any type of resource (e.g. container, template, script, vm).

⏰ Make it possible to add/remove resources during the lifecycle of a lab.
