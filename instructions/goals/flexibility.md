# More Flexibility in Content Flows

✅ Support more/richer content types for better learning experiences

✅ Make it easier to customize and extend the way users view and interact with lab content.

🏗️ Make it possible to choose the content flow that fits the use-case of the lab, instead of only allowing linear paths and forced check completions.
